**Openstack Barbican Dashboard for Horizon**
-
A work-in-progress dashboard that runs inside Openstack Horizon.
This project started as a personal project at work, in order to give a simple way to import an manage SSL certificates to be used with LBaaSv2.

This dashboard was developed on RedHat Openstack Platform starting with the Newton release (10.0). 
Also, it is still (mostly off-working-time) in development.
